- Manually removed spaces from numeric data file to make it easy to read 
- Use the file with both numeric and categorical features
- Strategies when False Positives are more expensive than False Negatives 
  - via cost function
    - Change the function itself
      - the main function
      - penalty component
    - Change function parameters
      - More weight to observation with positive class
        - oversample positive class
          - synthetic sample generation (like SMOTE)
          - give more weights
        - undersample sample negative class
  - via optimizing thresholds used to turn output probabilities into class labels - valid only for models which
- Models
  - Logistic
  - SVM
  - Boosted trees
